# 🚀 GenAI Autonomous Data Agent

## AI-Powered Data Analysis with GPU Acceleration & Advanced ML

An autonomous data science co-pilot that transforms raw datasets into actionable insights.
Powered by GenAI, SQL, Machine Learning, and NVIDIA GPU acceleration, this agent automates the entire data workflow: cleaning, EDA, modeling, visualization, natural language querying, and dashboard generation.

💡 Think of it as your Autonomous Data Scientist — always ready, always fast.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Data Preprocessing – Cleans and preprocesses raw datasets automatically (missing values, scaling, encoding).
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Generates correlations, distributions, and smart visualizations.
✅ Automated ML Modeling – Trains & benchmarks multiple models (XGBoost, LightGBM, PyTorch, TensorFlow).
✅ GPU Acceleration – Leverages NVIDIA RAPIDS for blazing-fast DataFrame ops and ML pipelines.
✅ Explainable AI – Explains predictions in plain English using SHAP & LIME.
✅ Natural Language → SQL – Converts plain English queries into optimized SQL with GenAI + NVIDIA NeMo.
✅ Interactive Dashboards – Generates insights in Streamlit dashboards exportable to PDF/Excel.
✅ Autonomous Agent Loop – Iteratively improves models, queries, and dashboards without manual intervention.
